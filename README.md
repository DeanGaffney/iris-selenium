# Iris Selenium Agent

This repository contains the [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) agent for my final year project [Iris](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris). The Selenium agent was written in Java using a Selenium wrapper library called [Selenide](https://selenide.org/). This agent demonstrates the versatility of Iris by using Selenium to scrape guitar prices from two music store websites [Thomann](https://www.thomann.de/ie/index.html) and [MusicStore](https://www.musicstore.de). The scraped prices are then pushed into Iris and the prices are displayed on an Iris dashboard chart in real time.

## Agent Schema
The following is the schema that was created in Iris for the agent.
